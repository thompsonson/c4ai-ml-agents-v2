# Paper-to-Implementation Process for Agentic Reasoning Behaviors

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 2025-09-22
**Purpose:** Systematic process for applying the Agent Design Process to research papers, producing both implementations and blog posts

## Overview

This document provides a systematic methodology for analyzing research papers about agentic reasoning behaviors using **Matt Thompson's Agent Design Process** (derived from Russell & Norvig), implementing the agents within the ML Agents v2 DDD architecture, and documenting the complete analysis as blog posts.

**The Agent Design Process (Applied to Papers)**:
1. **Environment Analysis** - Analyze the paper's task environment using PEAS framework
2. **Environment Specification** - Determine environment properties (observable, deterministic, etc.)
3. **Agent Function Definition** - Extract the ideal behavior from the paper
4. **Agent Type Selection** - Choose appropriate architecture for the paper's approach
5. **Agent Program Implementation** - Implement within our DDD constraints

**Dual Output**: Each paper analysis produces both a working `ReasoningAgentService` and a comprehensive blog post documenting the complete Agent Design Process.

## Step 1: Environment Analysis (PEAS Framework)

### 1.1 Paper Environment Specification

**Objective**: Apply PEAS framework to understand the paper's task environment

**PEAS Analysis Template**:
```markdown
## Paper: [Title] - PEAS Analysis

### Performance Measure
- **What does success look like?** [Extract from paper's evaluation section]
- **How is reasoning quality measured?** [Paper's metrics: accuracy, reasoning steps, etc.]
- **What behaviors indicate good performance?** [Specific criteria from paper]

### Environment
- **Task Domain**: [Mathematical reasoning, logical puzzles, factual QA, etc.]
- **Problem Characteristics**: [Simple/complex, single-step/multi-step, etc.]
- **Available Information**: [What context/knowledge is provided?]

### Actuators (Actions the Agent Can Take)
- **Primary Actions**: [Generate reasoning steps, ask questions, make decisions, etc.]
- **Output Format**: [How does the agent communicate its reasoning?]
- **Decision Points**: [Where does the agent make choices?]

### Sensors (What the Agent Perceives)
- **Input Format**: [Question text, context, examples, etc.]
- **Available Context**: [What information can the agent access?]
- **Feedback Signals**: [Any intermediate feedback or validation?]
```

### 1.2 Environment Properties Analysis

**Determine Environment Characteristics**:
```markdown
### Environment Properties (Check all that apply)

#### Observability
- [ ] **Fully Observable**: Agent has complete information about environment state
- [ ] **Partially Observable**: Agent has limited/incomplete information
- [ ] **Unobservable**: Agent must work with minimal information

#### Determinism
- [ ] **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
- [ ] **Stochastic**: Randomness affects outcomes (LLM sampling, etc.)
- [ ] **Strategic**: Other agents affect the outcome

#### Episodic vs Sequential
- [ ] **Episodic**: Each question is independent
- [ ] **Sequential**: Previous reasoning affects future decisions

#### Static vs Dynamic
- [ ] **Static**: Environment doesn't change during reasoning
- [ ] **Dynamic**: Environment changes while agent reasons

#### Discrete vs Continuous
- [ ] **Discrete**: Finite number of states and actions
- [ ] **Continuous**: Continuous state/action spaces

#### Single vs Multi-Agent
- [ ] **Single Agent**: Only this agent in the environment
- [ ] **Multi-Agent**: Multiple reasoning agents or human interaction
```

## Step 2: Agent Function Definition

### 2.1 Abstract Agent Function (Mathematical Mapping)

**Objective**: Define the ideal behavior the paper describes, abstractly

**Agent Function Analysis**:
```markdown
### Agent Function: f: P* → A

#### Percept Sequence (P*)
- **Initial Percept**: [Question + any initial context]
- **Reasoning Percepts**: [Information gathered during reasoning]
- **Termination Percept**: [What signals the end of reasoning]

#### Action Set (A)
- **Reasoning Actions**: [Generate thoughts, ask questions, evaluate options]
- **Decision Actions**: [Choose between alternatives, commit to answers]
- **Communication Actions**: [Format output, explain reasoning]

#### Ideal Mapping (from paper's perspective)
**f(percept_sequence) = action_that_maximizes_performance_measure**

#### Paper's Claimed Optimization
- **What does the paper claim this agent does better than others?**
- **What specific mapping improvement does the approach provide?**
- **Under what conditions does this function excel?**
```

### 2.2 Algorithm Extraction

**Extract the paper's step-by-step reasoning process**:
```markdown
### Core Algorithm (from paper)

#### Initialization
1. [How does the agent start reasoning?]
2. [What initial state/context is established?]

#### Reasoning Loop
1. [Step 1]: [What happens first in each reasoning cycle?]
2. [Step 2]: [Next action in the reasoning process]
3. [Decision Point]: [How does agent choose between options?]
4. [State Update]: [How does internal understanding evolve?]
5. [Termination Check]: [When does reasoning stop?]

#### Finalization
1. [How does agent extract final answer?]
2. [How is confidence/certainty assessed?]
3. [What constitutes the complete output?]

#### Key Innovations (what makes this different)
- [Specific technique #1 that differentiates this approach]
- [Specific technique #2 that differentiates this approach]
- [Why this is better than existing approaches]
```

## Step 3: Agent Type Selection

### 3.1 Architecture Classification

**Determine the appropriate agent architecture for this paper's approach**:

```markdown
### Agent Architecture Analysis

#### Simple Reflex Agent
- [ ] **Condition-Action Rules**: Does the agent use simple if-then rules?
- [ ] **No State**: Does reasoning not depend on history?
- [ ] **Direct Response**: Immediate response to current percept?

#### Model-Based Reflex Agent
- [ ] **Internal State**: Does agent maintain reasoning state across steps?
- [ ] **World Model**: Does agent track what's been reasoned about?
- [ ] **State-Dependent Actions**: Do actions depend on internal state?

#### Goal-Based Agent
- [ ] **Explicit Goals**: Does agent work toward specific reasoning objectives?
- [ ] **Planning**: Does agent plan sequences of reasoning steps?
- [ ] **Goal Optimization**: Are actions chosen to achieve reasoning goals?

#### Utility-Based Agent
- [ ] **Preference Modeling**: Does agent evaluate quality of different reasoning paths?
- [ ] **Utility Maximization**: Does agent optimize for reasoning quality metrics?
- [ ] **Trade-off Management**: Does agent balance multiple objectives?

#### Learning Agent
- [ ] **Performance Improvement**: Does agent learn from reasoning experience?
- [ ] **Adaptation**: Does reasoning strategy evolve over time?
- [ ] **Knowledge Update**: Does agent update its reasoning approach?

### Selected Architecture: [Choose based on analysis above]
**Justification**: [Why this architecture fits the paper's approach]
```

### 3.2 Computational Complexity Analysis

**Analyze the computational requirements**:
```markdown
### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- **Best Case**: O([analysis])
- **Average Case**: O([analysis])
- **Worst Case**: O([analysis])

#### Space Complexity
- **Memory Requirements**: [What must be stored during reasoning]
- **State Size**: [How large can the reasoning state grow]

#### LLM API Calls
- **Minimum Calls**: [Best case scenario]
- **Expected Calls**: [Typical reasoning episode]
- **Maximum Calls**: [Worst case or complex problems]

#### Scalability Concerns
- [How does performance degrade with problem complexity?]
- [Are there bottlenecks in the reasoning process?]
```

## Step 4: Agent Program Implementation

### 4.1 DDD Domain Design

**Objective**: Implement only the core reasoning algorithm, leveraging existing infrastructure

**Agent Program Template**:

```python
class {PaperName}AgentService(ReasoningAgentService):
    """Implementation of {paper_title} reasoning approach.

    Reference: {authors} ({year}). {title}. {venue}.

    Agent Function: {input} → {reasoning_process} → {output}
    Performance Measure: {what_constitutes_success}
    """

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Focus only on agent-specific reasoning parameters
        self._reasoning_config = {
            # Extract from paper analysis - what does THIS agent need?
            "max_reasoning_steps": 5,
            "decision_threshold": 0.7,
            # No infrastructure concerns here
        }

    async def answer_question(self, question: Question, config: AgentConfig) -> Answer:
        """Execute the paper's core reasoning algorithm"""

        # Step 1: Initialize agent state (what does the agent start knowing?)
        reasoning_state = self._initialize_reasoning_state(question, config)

        # Step 2: Execute paper's core algorithm
        while not self._is_reasoning_complete(reasoning_state):
            reasoning_state = await self._execute_reasoning_step(reasoning_state, config)

        # Step 3: Extract final decision
        final_answer = self._extract_final_answer(reasoning_state)

        return self._construct_answer_with_reasoning_trace(
            question, reasoning_state.trace, final_answer
        )

    async def _execute_reasoning_step(self, state: ReasoningState, config: AgentConfig) -> ReasoningState:
        """Single reasoning step - implement paper's core logic here"""
        # This is where the paper's innovation lives
        # Everything else is handled by our existing infrastructure
        raise NotImplementedError("Implement paper's reasoning step logic")

    def _is_reasoning_complete(self, state: ReasoningState) -> bool:
        """Determine when reasoning should stop - paper-specific logic"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Implement paper's termination criteria")
```

### 2.2 Reasoning State Management

**Objective**: Define minimal state required for the paper's algorithm

**State Design Questions**:
1. What does the agent need to remember between reasoning steps?
2. How does the agent's understanding evolve during reasoning?
3. What triggers the agent to change its approach or terminate?

```python
@dataclass
class ReasoningState:
    """Minimal state required for this paper's reasoning algorithm"""

    # Core state from paper analysis
    current_question: Question
    reasoning_steps: List[ReasoningStep]
    confidence_scores: List[float]

    # Paper-specific state (extract from algorithm analysis)
    # Example for Tree-of-Thoughts:
    # thought_tree: ThoughtTree
    # current_depth: int
    # explored_paths: List[Path]

    # Example for Chain-of-Verification:
    # initial_answer: str
    # verification_questions: List[Question]
    # verification_results: List[VerificationResult]

    def add_reasoning_step(self, step: ReasoningStep) -> 'ReasoningState':
        """Immutable state update following DDD principles"""
        return ReasoningState(
            current_question=self.current_question,
            reasoning_steps=self.reasoning_steps + [step],
            confidence_scores=self.confidence_scores + [step.confidence],
            # ... other state updates
        )
```

### 2.3 Prompt Strategy Design

**Objective**: Extract and implement the paper's prompting approach without over-engineering

**Hands-On Prompt Analysis**:

1. **Find the paper's actual prompts**
   - Look for example prompts in the paper (often in appendix)
   - Identify the key instructions that drive the reasoning behavior
   - Note any special formatting or structure requirements

2. **Extract the essential prompting pattern**
   ```markdown
   ### Paper Prompt Analysis

   #### System Instructions (What role/behavior does the agent assume?)
   [Extract the key behavioral instructions from the paper]

   #### Task Instructions (How does the agent approach the specific task?)
   [Extract the step-by-step or strategic guidance]

   #### Format Requirements (What structure should the output follow?)
   [Extract any specific formatting requirements]

   #### Examples (What does good reasoning look like?)
   [Copy the paper's best examples, if any]
   ```

3. **Implement minimal viable prompts**
   ```python
   def _create_reasoning_prompt(self, question: Question, reasoning_state: ReasoningState) -> str:
       """Create prompt for current reasoning step - extracted from paper"""

       # Use paper's actual language/instructions where possible
       system_instruction = """
       [Paper's core behavioral instruction]
       """

       task_instruction = """
       [Paper's specific task guidance]
       """

       # Build context from current reasoning state
       context = self._build_context_from_state(reasoning_state)

       return f"{system_instruction}\n\n{task_instruction}\n\n{context}\n\nQuestion: {question.text}"
   ```

**Key Principle**: Copy the paper's prompting strategy as directly as possible, don't try to improve it initially.

## Phase 3: Implementation and Testing

### 3.1 Hands-On Implementation Process

**Objective**: Build and validate the core agent logic step by step

**Step-by-Step Approach**:

1. **Start with paper's simplest example**
   - Find the clearest, most straightforward example from the paper
   - Implement just enough logic to handle that one example
   - Verify the reasoning pattern matches the paper's description

2. **Incrementally add complexity**
   - Add handling for the paper's more complex examples
   - Implement edge cases mentioned in the paper
   - Test each addition against paper's expected behavior

3. **Focus on agent logic validation**
   ```python
   class Test{PaperName}AgentLogic:
       """Test the core reasoning logic, not infrastructure"""

       def test_paper_example_1(self):
           """Test against paper's first example"""
           question = Question(text="[Example from paper]")
           agent = {PaperName}AgentService()

           answer = await agent.answer_question(question, default_config)

           # Verify reasoning pattern, not exact text
           assert self._has_expected_reasoning_structure(answer.reasoning_trace)
           assert self._reaches_correct_conclusion(answer.extracted_answer)

       def test_reasoning_termination(self):
           """Verify agent stops reasoning appropriately"""
           # Test the paper's termination criteria

       def test_state_transitions(self):
           """Verify reasoning state evolves as paper describes"""
           # Test internal state management
   ```

### 3.2 Manual Validation Process

**Paper Fidelity Check**:

1. **Compare reasoning patterns manually**
   - Run agent on paper's examples
   - Compare reasoning steps with paper's descriptions
   - Look for structural similarities, not exact text matches

2. **Validate decision points**
   - Check that agent makes choices where paper indicates choices
   - Verify choice criteria match paper's guidance
   - Test edge cases where paper discusses different behaviors

3. **Performance reality check**
   - Test on a subset of paper's evaluation data (if available)
   - Compare qualitative reasoning quality
   - Don't obsess over exact performance numbers initially

**Hands-On Testing Template**:
```markdown
