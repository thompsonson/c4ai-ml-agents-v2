# ML Agents v2 Architecture Documentation

## Overview

**ML Agents v2 is a complete architectural redesign and clean break from v1.** This represents a fundamental reimagining of the reasoning research platform, transitioning from the v1 Jupyter notebook prototype to a production-ready CLI application built from the ground up.

### Clean Break from v1

**v2 is NOT an evolution of v1 - it is a complete rewrite with:**
- **New Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design with clean architecture layers vs. monolithic notebook
- **New Interface**: CLI application vs. Jupyter notebook interface
- **New Data Model**: Structured entities and value objects vs. ad-hoc data handling
- **New Infrastructure**: OpenRouter integration, SQLite persistence, dependency injection vs. direct API calls
- **New Codebase**: Fresh implementation following architectural principles vs. research prototype code

**Migration Strategy**: v2 will be developed as a separate project. v1 remains available for reference but will not be maintained once v2 is production-ready.

### v2 Design Principles

The v2 redesign focuses on Domain-Driven Design principles, clean architecture separation, and robust evaluation workflows for comparing reasoning approaches across diverse benchmarks.

Key architectural decisions include using SQLite for development with PostgreSQL extensibility, OpenRouter for unified LLM provider access, and a synchronous CLI execution model that prioritizes simplicity and real-time progress feedback over complex concurrency management.

The platform supports systematic evaluation of reasoning approaches (None, Chain of Thought, and future extensions) against preprocessed benchmarks, with comprehensive result tracking and failure analysis to support research into task-approach fit and reasoning effectiveness.
