# ML Agents v2 Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Domain Layer (Foundation) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Implemented core domain entities (Evaluation, PreprocessedBenchmark), value objects (AgentConfig, Question, Answer, FailureReason, ReasoningTrace), repository interfaces, and ReasoningAgentService abstractions. Established clean DDD boundaries with pure business logic and no external dependencies.

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Set up SQLAlchemy database with Alembic migrations, dependency injection container, structured logging, repository implementations, OpenRouter client integration, error mapping, and health checking. Established 12-factor app configuration with environment variables.

## Phase 3: Application Services ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Implemented orchestration layer with EvaluationOrchestrator, BenchmarkProcessor, and ResultsAnalyzer. Created DTOs for application boundaries, service coordination patterns, transaction management, and progress tracking. Achieved 427 passing tests with pragmatic high-value testing approach.

## Phase 4: CLI Interface ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Built Click-based CLI with evaluate/benchmark/health commands, Rich progress display, error handling, configuration validation, and agent type mapping. Provided user-friendly interface for creating evaluations, managing benchmarks, and monitoring system health.

## Phase 5: Testing ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Established comprehensive testing strategy with domain unit tests, application integration tests, infrastructure tests, and CLI acceptance tests. Implemented pragmatic approach focusing on critical business workflows and integration points. OpenRouter mocking strategy enabled testing without real API calls.

## Phase 6: Reasoning Domain Logic Retrofit ‚ö†Ô∏è SUPERSEDED

Initial implementation of domain/infrastructure separation with structured output parsing. Created OutputParserFactory with model capability detection (StructuredLogProbs/Instructor), infrastructure Pydantic models, and ReasoningInfrastructureService. **Architecture later identified as flawed** (single provider assumption, concrete injection, "default" model name bug). Superseded by Phase 9 multi-provider factory pattern with corrected architecture.

## Phase 7: Documentation Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Updated)

Created comprehensive v2 documentation suite covering domain model, architecture patterns, infrastructure requirements, testing strategy, and project structure. **Documentation updated (commit 64e5f49)** to reflect corrected multi-provider factory architecture, fixing original single-provider assumptions that prevented clean interfaces and proper dependency injection.
