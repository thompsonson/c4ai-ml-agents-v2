# ML Agents v2 Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Domain Layer (Foundation) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Evaluation entity with lifecycle management
- [x] PreprocessedBenchmark entity
- [x] AgentConfig value object
- [x] Question, Answer, EvaluationResults value objects
- [x] ReasoningTrace, FailureReason value objects
- [x] ReasoningAgentService interface
- [x] ReasoningAgentServiceFactory
- [x] None agent implementation
- [x] Chain of Thought agent implementation
- [x] Repository interfaces (EvaluationRepository, BenchmarkRepository)

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] ApplicationConfig with environment variables
- [ ] Database models (SQLAlchemy)
- [ ] Alembic migration setup and initial schema
- [ ] Dependency injection container
- [ ] Structured logging configuration
- [ ] Repository implementations
- [ ] OpenRouter client integration
- [ ] Error mapping (OpenRouter → FailureReason)
- [ ] BENCHMARK_REGISTRY constant and mapping logic
- [ ] Health check service (database + OpenRouter connectivity)

## Phase 3: Application Services

- [ ] EvaluationOrchestrator
- [ ] BenchmarkProcessor
- [ ] Transaction boundary implementation
- [ ] Service coordination patterns
- [ ] Progress tracking for real-time updates

## Phase 4: CLI Interface

- [ ] Click command structure
- [ ] evaluate create/run/list commands
- [ ] benchmark list/show commands
- [ ] health command
- [ ] Progress display with Rich
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] AgentConfig construction from CLI arguments
- [ ] Agent type mapping (cot → chain_of_thought)

## Phase 5: Testing

- [ ] Domain layer unit tests
- [ ] Application service integration tests
- [ ] Infrastructure repository tests
- [ ] CLI acceptance tests
- [ ] OpenRouter mocking strategy
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests

## Implementation Order

1. **Domain Layer** - Pure business logic, no dependencies
2. **Infrastructure** - Database, external APIs, implements domain interfaces
3. **Application Services** - Orchestrates domain + infrastructure
4. **CLI** - User interface consuming application services
5. **Testing** - Comprehensive coverage across all layers

## Notes

- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Test each layer independently before proceeding
- Maintain spec-driven approach: implementation follows documentation
- Use AI for consistent code generation from specifications
