**Testing Status**: 427 tests passing with pragmatic approach focusing on critical business workflows, error scenarios, and integration points rather than exhaustive coverage.

## Phase 6: Reasoning Domain Logic Retrofit ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Purpose**: Retrofit existing codebase with proper domain/infrastructure boundaries and simplified structured output parsing

### Domain Layer Updates

- [x] Refactor ReasoningAgentService implementations to use PromptStrategy value objects
- [x] Implement ReasoningResult domain value object with business logic methods
- [x] Update NoneAgentService and ChainOfThoughtAgentService with domain-only logic
- [x] Remove infrastructure concerns from existing reasoning agent implementations

### Infrastructure Layer Updates

- [x] Add structured output parsing dependencies (instructor, structured-logprobs)
- [x] Implement OutputParserFactory with model capability detection (StructuredLogprobs OR Instructor, not fallback)
- [x] Create infrastructure Pydantic output models (DirectAnswerOutput, ChainOfThoughtOutput)
- [x] Build ReasoningInfrastructureService for real API integration (no mock mode)
- [x] Add model capabilities registry with logprobs support detection

### Application Layer Updates

- [x] Update EvaluationOrchestrator to use ReasoningInfrastructureService
- [x] Modify service coordination to separate domain from infrastructure calls
- [x] Update partial failure handling (log failures, continue evaluation, include in results)

### Testing Updates

- [x] Update domain layer tests to focus on business logic only
- [x] Add infrastructure layer tests using mocked external services
- [x] Create integration tests for domain-infrastructure boundary
- [x] Update mocking strategy to separate domain from infrastructure concerns
- [x] **BLOCKER CHECK**: Verify pragmatic testing possible without real API calls

**Constraints Applied**:

- Real API integration only (no mock mode for development)
- Single parsing strategy per model (no fallback complexity)
- No retry logic (keep simple)
- Single development environment
- Defer integration tests until pragmatic approach confirmed

**Target**: Clean domain/infrastructure separation with simplified dual parsing strategy

## Phase 7: Documentation Architecture ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] README.md with reading guide and document index
- [x] v2-domain-model.md with entities and business rules
- [x] v2-ubiquitous-language.md with shared vocabulary
- [x] v2-core-behaviour-definition.md with user workflows
- [x] v2-reasoning-domain-logic.md with domain business logic boundaries
- [x] v2-application-services-architecture.md with service coordination patterns
- [x] v2-cli-design.md with command interface specifications
- [x] v2-data-model.md with database schema design
- [x] v2-infrastructure-requirements.md with external dependencies and structured output parsing
- [x] v2-project-structure.md with DDD layer organization
- [x] v2-testing-strategy.md with quality assurance approach
- [x] v2-task-tracker.md with implementation status tracking

**Documentation Updates**: Removed v2-agents.md (non-DDD document), added v2-reasoning-domain-logic.md with proper domain/infrastructure boundaries.

## Implementation Order

1. **Domain Layer** - Pure business logic, no dependencies
2. **Infrastructure** - Database, external APIs, implements domain interfaces
3. **Application Services** - Orchestrates domain + infrastructure
4. **CLI** - User interface consuming application services
5. **Testing** - Comprehensive coverage across all layers
6. **Documentation** - Architecture documentation following DDD principles

## Architecture Achievements

### Clean Architecture Implementation

- Clear domain/infrastructure boundaries maintained
- Domain services contain pure business logic
- Infrastructure handles external API integration with structured output parsing
- Application services coordinate without containing business logic

### Domain-Driven Design Patterns

- Ubiquitous language established across team
- Domain events foundation prepared (future enhancement)
- Aggregate boundaries clearly defined (Evaluation, PreprocessedBenchmark)
- Value objects properly implemented with equality semantics

### Research Platform Features

- Structured failure taxonomy for research analysis
- Real-time progress tracking during evaluation execution
- Benchmarks registry with user-friendly naming
- Multiple reasoning approach support with extensible factory pattern

### Infrastructure Sophistication

- Dual parsing strategy (StructuredLogprobs/Instructor) based on model capabilities
- 12-factor app configuration with environment variable externalization
- Health checking for database and API connectivity
- DET-inspired patterns for enhanced error handling and configuration

## Notes

- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Test each layer independently before proceeding
- Maintain spec-driven approach: implementation follows documentation
- Use AI for consistent code generation from specifications
- Domain logic kept separate from infrastructure concerns following DDD principles
