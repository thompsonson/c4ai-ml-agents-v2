## Phase 6: Reasoning Domain Logic Retrofit ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Purpose**: Retrofit existing codebase with proper domain/infrastructure boundaries and simplified structured output parsing

### Domain Layer Updates

- [x] Create infrastructure Pydantic output models (DirectAnswerOutput, ChainOfThoughtOutput)
- [x] Build ReasoningInfrastructureService for real API integration (no mock mode)
- [x] Add model capabilities registry with logprobs support detection

### Application Layer Updates

- [x] Add infrastructure layer tests using mocked external services
- [x] Create integration tests for domain-infrastructure boundary

### Benefits Delivered

- **Graceful Interruption**: Ctrl+C preserves all completed questions
- **Incremental Progress**: Real-time progress with actual saved results
- **Resume Capability**: Continue evaluations from exact stopping point
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Cross-evaluation question-level analysis
- **Research Value**: Partial evaluation results have independent value

**Target**: Production-ready incremental persistence enabling robust LLM research workflows

## Implementation Order

1. **Domain Layer** - Pure business logic, no dependencies
2. **Infrastructure** - Database, external APIs, implements domain interfaces
3. **Application Services** - Orchestrates domain + infrastructure
4. **CLI** - User interface consuming application services
5. **Testing** - Comprehensive coverage across all layers
6. **Documentation** - Architecture documentation following DDD principles
7. **Individual Question Persistence** - Enhanced persistence for research resilience

## Architecture Achievements
