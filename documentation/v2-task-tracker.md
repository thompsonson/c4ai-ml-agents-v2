# ML Agents v2 Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Domain Layer (Foundation) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Implemented core domain entities (Evaluation, PreprocessedBenchmark), value objects (AgentConfig, Question, Answer, FailureReason, ReasoningTrace), repository interfaces, and ReasoningAgentService abstractions. Established clean DDD boundaries with pure business logic and no external dependencies.

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Set up SQLAlchemy database with Alembic migrations, dependency injection container, structured logging, repository implementations, OpenRouter client integration, error mapping, and health checking. Established 12-factor app configuration with environment variables.

## Phase 3: Application Services ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Implemented orchestration layer with EvaluationOrchestrator, BenchmarkProcessor, and ResultsAnalyzer. Created DTOs for application boundaries, service coordination patterns, transaction management, and progress tracking. Achieved 427 passing tests with pragmatic high-value testing approach.

## Phase 4: CLI Interface ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Built Click-based CLI with evaluate/benchmark/health commands, Rich progress display, error handling, configuration validation, and agent type mapping. Provided user-friendly interface for creating evaluations, managing benchmarks, and monitoring system health.

## Phase 5: Testing ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Established comprehensive testing strategy with domain unit tests, application integration tests, infrastructure tests, and CLI acceptance tests. Implemented pragmatic approach focusing on critical business workflows and integration points. OpenRouter mocking strategy enabled testing without real API calls.

## Phase 6: Reasoning Domain Logic Retrofit ‚ö†Ô∏è SUPERSEDED

Initial implementation of domain/infrastructure separation with structured output parsing. Created OutputParserFactory with model capability detection (StructuredLogProbs/Instructor), infrastructure Pydantic models, and ReasoningInfrastructureService. **Architecture later identified as flawed** (single provider assumption, concrete injection, "default" model name bug). Superseded by Phase 9 multi-provider factory pattern with corrected architecture.

## Phase 7: Documentation Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Updated)

Created comprehensive v2 documentation suite covering domain model, architecture patterns, infrastructure requirements, testing strategy, and project structure. **Documentation updated (commit 64e5f49)** to reflect corrected multi-provider factory architecture, fixing original single-provider assumptions that prevented clean interfaces and proper dependency injection.

## Phase 7b: Code-Documentation Alignment ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Refactored implementation to match corrected Phase 7 multi-provider architecture, fixing Phase 6 debt. Renamed `OutputParserFactory` ‚Üí `LLMClientFactory`, updated Container to inject factory (not concrete client), removed internal factory creation from `ReasoningInfrastructureService`, and updated BDD tests to mock at factory boundary. **BDD async mocking issues resolved (commit ec437ad)** - all 8 BDD tests passing. Code now matches documentation exactly with proper dependency injection ready for Phase 9 multi-provider support.

**Test Status:**
- ‚úÖ Quality Gates: All passing (pytest, mypy, black, ruff)
- ‚úÖ BDD Tests: 8/8 passing (async mocking fixed, factory pattern validated)
- ‚úÖ Architecture: Factory injection working correctly
- ‚úÖ Foundation: Phase 9 multi-provider support ready

## Phase 8: Individual Question Persistence ‚úÖ COMPLETED

Implemented per-question result persistence with `EvaluationQuestionResult` entity, repository interface, and SQLAlchemy implementation with 3 indexes. Updated `EvaluationOrchestrator` to save individual question results incrementally during execution, enabling real-time progress tracking and cross-evaluation analytics. Production validated with 2,679 question results. Interruption handling/resume capability and computed results pattern deferred to Phase 10.

## Phase 9: Multi-Provider Architecture üìã **PLANNED**
