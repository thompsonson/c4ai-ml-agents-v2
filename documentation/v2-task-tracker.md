# ML Agents v2 Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Domain Layer (Foundation) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Evaluation entity with lifecycle management
- [x] PreprocessedBenchmark entity
- [x] AgentConfig value object
- [x] Question, Answer, EvaluationResults value objects
- [x] ReasoningTrace, FailureReason value objects
- [x] ReasoningAgentService interface
- [x] ReasoningAgentServiceFactory
- [x] None agent implementation
- [x] Chain of Thought agent implementation
- [x] Repository interfaces (EvaluationRepository, BenchmarkRepository)

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] ApplicationConfig with environment variables
- [x] Database models (SQLAlchemy)
- [x] Alembic migration setup and initial schema
- [x] Dependency injection container
- [x] Structured logging configuration
- [x] Repository implementations
- [x] OpenRouter client integration
- [x] Error mapping (OpenRouter → FailureReason)
- [x] BENCHMARK_REGISTRY constant and mapping logic
- [x] Health check service (database + OpenRouter connectivity)

## Phase 3: Application Services ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] EvaluationOrchestrator (async evaluation execution, status management)
- [x] BenchmarkProcessor (benchmark management and validation)
- [x] ResultsAnalyzer (evaluation results analysis and export)
- [x] TransactionManager (transaction boundary implementation)
- [x] ErrorMapper (external API error mapping to domain failures)
- [x] ProgressTracker (progress tracking for real-time updates)
- [x] DTOs (EvaluationInfo, ProgressInfo, ValidationResult, BenchmarkInfo, EvaluationSummary)
- [x] Service coordination patterns and dependency injection
- [x] High-value testing implementation (427 tests passing)

## Phase 4: CLI Interface ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Click command structure
- [x] evaluate create/run/list commands
- [x] benchmark list/show commands
- [x] health command
- [x] Progress display with Rich
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] Configuration validation
- [x] AgentConfig construction from CLI arguments
- [x] Agent type mapping (cot → chain_of_thought)

## Phase 5: Testing ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Domain layer unit tests (comprehensive coverage)
- [x] Application service integration tests (high-value pragmatic approach)
- [x] Infrastructure repository tests (database + OpenRouter integration)
- [x] CLI acceptance tests (comprehensive command testing)
- [x] OpenRouter mocking strategy (implemented and working)
- [x] End-to-end workflow tests (covered in acceptance tests)

**Testing Status**: 427 tests passing with pragmatic approach focusing on critical business workflows, error scenarios, and integration points rather than exhaustive coverage.

## Implementation Order

1. **Domain Layer** - Pure business logic, no dependencies
2. **Infrastructure** - Database, external APIs, implements domain interfaces
3. **Application Services** - Orchestrates domain + infrastructure
4. **CLI** - User interface consuming application services
5. **Testing** - Comprehensive coverage across all layers

## Notes

- Each phase builds on previous phases
- Test each layer independently before proceeding
- Maintain spec-driven approach: implementation follows documentation
- Use AI for consistent code generation from specifications
